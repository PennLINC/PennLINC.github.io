# First day/week tasks

## New Hire Checklist:
[![New Hire Checklist](/assets/pdfs/new_hire_checklist.pdf)](/assets/pdfs/new_hire_checklist.pdf) 



## First day:
1. Meet with Onboard@Penn in person
    1. You can make an appointment online [here](https://kiosk.na4.qless.com/kiosk/app/home/17), but it is not needed.
    2. Complete section 2 of Form 1-9.
    3. You must bring original documents with you for identification. List of acceptable documents [here](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-acceptable-documents).
2. Get PennCard in person
    1. You can make an appointment online [here](https://penncard.business-services.upenn.edu/appointments), but it is not needed.
    2. It might take a couple of minutes for your PennCard to give you access to the buildings you need access to, so before you leave Richards it is a good idea to ask someone else in the lab to check their slack & be willing to come let you in if your card doesn’t work at first to get back into Richards.
3. Complete additional Workday inbox onboarding tasks, such as your W-4.

Both the Onboard@Penn & PennCard offices are located in the Penn Bookstore, up the escalator to the second floor. The offices are next to each other. The Penn Bookstore is about a ~10 min walk from Richards:
3601 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104
