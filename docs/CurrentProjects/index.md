# How to Add Your Project

If you'd like to add your project to this list, read on! Successful/complete documentation of your project requires two things:

1. A Github Pages site, and
2. An entry on this page

## Github Pages Documentation

We use Github Pages to reproducibly document how we arrived at a scientific finding, usually for a paper or poster. A Github Pages site is a static website linked directly to a Github repository -- for example, this website is a Github Pages site for the Github repository [PennLINC/pennlinc.github.io](https://github.com/PennLINC/PennLINC.github.io). The underlying code is markdown and is rendered (converted) automatically into a website by Github. You'll want to create one of these sites for your project and its code repository. To learn how to do this, see [this tutorial](/docs/Contributing/project-documentation/).

## Project Page Entry

Lastly, you'll need to add your project to the list below.
To add a project to this list, please first read the [documentation guide](/docs/Contributing/documentation_guidelines) to familiarize yourself with the process of adding content to this website. When it comes time to add your project, simply add a Pull Request with your entry in the raw text of this table:

```
| Project Title |    Name    |               Link                |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| My Project    | Joe Bloggs | [My Project](myproject.github.io) |
| Project 2     | Jane Doe   | [Project 2](project2.github.io)   |
```

Simply add a new line, using the pipes `|` to delineate columns, and a newline to delineate rows — don't forget to use correct markdown formatting for links: `[title](url)`.

For additional information see the [Project Setup Page](/docs/LabHome/ProjectSetup/).
