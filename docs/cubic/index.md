# Using the CUBIC Cluster
{: .no_toc }

The CUBIC cluster is a very powerful set of servers that we can use for computing.
Although they are running Linux, familiarity with Linux does not mean that you will be able to effectively use CUBIC.
This section details how to get up and running on the CUBIC cluster.
In general we recommend using CUBIC as a high-performance computing cluster.
