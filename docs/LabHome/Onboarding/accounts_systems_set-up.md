# Accounts and systems set-up

## Accessing different accounts:

UPHS System Accounts Overview:

- PennKey = University accounts
    - Use this for anything Penn related/not through health system
    - Stace should set up your Penn Key account. Once he does, you should get an automated email with a 7-character Penn Key setup code and instructions on how to set up your Penn Key and enroll in two-step verification.
- UPHS = University of Pennsylvania Health Systems, i.e., hospital accounts
    - need to enroll in Duo Two-Factor Authentication as well
    - Stace should email you with your UPHS login information. This should include your Penn ID # and also a temporary password.
    - Reset your password from the temporary password according to the instructions in the email from Stace.
    - Access issues and password reset: Call the IS Service Desk at 215-662-7474
    - Use this for anything Penn Medicine related
    
- PMACS = IT accounts that services both University & UPHS sides
    - PMACS hosts “static” datasets – e.g., curated datasets as well as processed derivatives.
    - Stace will create your PMACS account.
    - Before attempting to log into any system you must complete the following 7 steps:
        
        1. Go to [this link](https://reset.pmacs.upenn.edu)
        
        2. On the right side of the page where it says "Sign In" for your username type in your PennKey username
        
        3. Use temporary password sent in email from Stace.
        
        4. Change/Reset your Password, "Old Password" is the temporary one you logged in with. Please make note of the Password Requirements Policies for new Passwords.
        
        5. To receive Email for when your Password will expire (important!) Click the *Enrollment* Tab.
        
        6. Complete the setup questions. Choose obvious answers that you will remember.
        
        7. You can continue to use this service in the future to Reset your Password if you forget it or to Unlock the account if you type in your password wrong too many times.
        
        If you are having any issues with the reset page, please close out of your browser and hit the refresh page button while on the reset website.
        
- VPN: Many websites as well as CUBIC and PMACS systems can only be accessed when on the PennMedicine network. When working from home, you will need to connect to VPN to access these resources.
When using VPN and / or when on PennMedicine network, some websites cannot be accessed. To enable access, download and install the [following certificates](https://cert-install.uphs.upenn.edu/) using your UPHS credentials (instructions provided with certificate download).
    - Big IP VPN client [Big IP VPN](http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/network/files/BIGIPMacEdgeClient2023.zip) will allow you to connect to all PMACS and UPHS systems. Use your UPHS credentials to connect.
    - Ivanti VPN client will allow you to connect to all PMACS systems. Use your PMACS credentials to connect.

Setting up email account:
