# Required online trainings

## HIPAA & CITI Training

**HIPAA Training**

- **HIPAA** should be assigned to you in WorkDay in the first day or two, but if it is not, you can search for it under Learning in WorkDay by searching “Protecting Patient Information (HIPAA) (Annual Program)”.

**CITI Modules**

- You will complete **CITI** training here: https://about.citiprogram.org. You should register with your personal email, or if you already have an account, you can affiliate it with the University of Pennsylvania. You will need to complete the Basic Human Subjects Protections and can complete either the Social Behavioral OR Biomedical modules (don’t do both).
- If you are working on a federally funded research project (which you most likely are), you will also need to complete the **Good Clinical Practice** module on the CITI website. You can complete either the Social Behavioral OR Biomedical module (don’t do both).

*Once completed, send a screenshot of your HIPAA certification in Workday, and send the CITI certificates to Stace. You cannot receive access to any databases or attend any meetings where PHI is discussed until these trainings are completed.*

## Additional Workday Trainings

In addition to CITI and HIPAA training, you will most likely be assigned additional trainings in Workday.

Sign into Workday using your Penn Key username & password (see instructions in ‘Tasks to do before you get here’)

Workday —> Menu —> Learning —> My Learning

- Your required learnings will show up here.
- In order to see your learning history, click the ‘View Your Learning History’ and it will produce a transcript of the courses/learning you have completed.
