# Seminars and Talks at Penn

There is a sometimes-belwidering array of relevant seminar series relevant to neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychiatry, and development.

We try to integrate these in a unified PennLINC google calender.  This is currently (Fall 2024) maintained by Juliette Brook, please contact her for access to this calendar if you a member of PennLINC.  The calendar is also mirrored for public viewing on the pennlinc.io frontpage (scroll to the bottom). Talks are announced daily on the #PennLINC_talks channel on slack. 

Several of the main seminar series are listed below:

### [LiBI](https://www.research.chop.edu/libi/events)

The Penn-CHOP Lifespan Brain Institute (led by section director Raquel Gur) runs a particularly relevant seminar series annually regarding brain development and psychopathology, as well as an annuall symposium. 


### [MINS](https://events.med.upenn.edu/mins/)

The Mahoney Institute for the Neurosciences at Penn runs an extremely high-quality seminar series that broadly covers the neurosciences.  


### [MindCORE](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/event-category/mindcore-seminar-series/)
