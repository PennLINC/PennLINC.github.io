## Paid time off at PennLINC

Time off is important!! We are human beings.  While our work is very important, failure to rest & recharge is a "lose-lose" -- less fun, more burnout, worse science.  Penn has very generous time off policies and all team members are encouraged to use their time off.

### Full time staff


### Graduate students and post-doctoral trainees
