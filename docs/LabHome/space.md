## PennLINC Space at Richards Medical Laboratories

We are extremely lucky to have beautiful, light-filled space in the recently renovated [Richards Medical Laboratories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richards_Medical_Research_Laboratories).  However, because of both space constraints (more team members than desks!) and an open floorplan, being  attuned to use of space is important for everyone’s work environment.  We strive for clear and constructive communication that helps us all do better science and enjoy our work.  All our work is highly collaborative, and collaboration is usually what makes science fun. Please reach out to Ted anytime and suggest updates to these pages as other important situations arise.

### In Person, Hybrid, and Remote Work

We have active collaborations with scientists all over the world; with modern technology (slack, github, zoom) this works great. Similarly, several critical members of our team work remotely, and many other team members follow a hybrid schedule.  As of the start of academic year 2025, we shoot for in-person attendance for specific days of the week, with the following priority: Tuesday (highest priority, for lab in-person meeting attendance) > Thursday > Wednesday.  


### Shared Space / Desks / Offices

Non-remote full-time employees get assigned a desk in the open space. Depending on the current team size, we may not have any desks available that can be assigned to visiting or rotating students. Similarly, full time team members who usually work remotely do not have permanent desks at Richards. Given this, we strive for  a culture of sharing -- where open desks are taken as needed.  If you arrive and a team member who lacks a permanent desk is sitting in your usual workspace, it is ok -- and can be worked out via direct communication (often, asking someone to pivot to another empty desk).  People with an assigned permanent desk that only use their desk on certain days of the week are asked to leave a post it note on their desk for people looking for a desk to know it is available. The #whereami channel on slack should always be used to keep your colleagues aware if you will be away for an extended period and your desk can be used.  (Note -- there is no need to post if you are going to be a way for brief periods during a day etc). Also, remember that Ted and the other faculty's offices are always a good option if they are not occupied. There is a key to the pod's offices in a lock box in the back at the office next to the printer. The code to the lock box is pinned to the #richards slack channel. 


### Lab Noise

We try to maintain an environment conducive to focused work (coding/writing) in the open space in the pod. In the open space, conversations should always use quiet voices. For anything beyond a brief exchange (inc zoom calls), an office or the common area outside of the pod should be used. The faculty offices can be used for meetings or conversations if they are unoccupied; all lab member have Ted's calendar and can use his office when it is not occupied. It is encouraged that we nicely remind each other of this – regardless of relative seniority/position – and strive for a practice of thanking the person who is providing the necessary reminder. Note that the soundproofing in the office spaces are not superb either and some volume control is needed even behind a closed door. If there are persistent issues with noise that you cannot resolve through direct communication with a colleague, feel free to talk to Ted (as ever).
