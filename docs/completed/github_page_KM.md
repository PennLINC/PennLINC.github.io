# Project Title

N-back Adversity: Association between Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status and Executive System Activation in Youth


## Project Lead(s):

Kristin Murtha

## Brief Project Description:

Prior work has shown that environmental adversity affects cognitive development. However, it is unclear how these challenges impact brain systems, like the executive system, which underlie cognition. The current study examined the association of neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) with executive system activation during a working memory task in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort
