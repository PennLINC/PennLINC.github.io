# Computation Basics

This section documents all the basic software, environments, and programs we recommend for day to day lab work. This list is not exhaustive and we welcome recommendations (see our [documentation guidelines](/docs/documentation/documentation_guidelines)). For more in-depth tutorials, set up, and usage of things like Flywheel, PMACS, or CUBIC, follow the links in the sidebar.
